Goodbye, John
I only ever think of you
Yeah, like
People hate me when I get mood swings
But people lately really been losing
So I move on (On, on, on)
If I'm allowed (Yeah)
People hate me when I'm unstable
Because I let emotion sit at the table
cnd people hate me when I'm a bad friend
Because you never know if I'm gonna be mad, when
You really gotta' tell me if we'll be separate
Because I'm feeling weird how we finally left it
I really can't take when you ignore me
Because I see your username is viewing my story
But I love a good cry in the shower
Like I love a quick good flight into outer space
'Cause I only ever travel in one direction
If I am allowed to be myself
People hate me when I get mood swings
But people lately really been losing
So I move on (On, on, on)
If I'm allowed
I only ever travel in one direction
I never ever wanna look in the mirror
I only ever think of you when I mention
What does keep me sane in this life
Yeah, I hate getting dirt on my white Nikes
Us together, it don't feel right
I only ever think of you in this life
She dumped me over breakfast
I was crying  maple syrup tears
People hate me when I get mood swings
But people lately really been losing
So I move on (On, on, on)
If I'm allowed
(cpocalypse Wow)
