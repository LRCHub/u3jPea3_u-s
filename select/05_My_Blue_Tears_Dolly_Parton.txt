Fly away from my window, little bluebird
Fly as far as you can away from here
And let not your song fall upon my ear
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears

For the one that I have loved
He has left me and gone
And I am in no mood for to hear your sad song

And bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here
Oh, trouble me not, go ye' elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears

For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away
And I am in no mood for the sunshine today

'Cause I don't know when or if ever again
I will see his sweet face but I fear
It's forever goodbye though I can't say why
But I'll sit here and cry my lonley blue tears

Go spread your blue wings
Light your blue sky
I'll shed my blue tears
My blue tears
