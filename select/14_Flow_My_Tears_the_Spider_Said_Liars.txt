Well, the portions of heaven they gave to a few
So the lions and tigers they eat really well
But the desperate teenager's under a spell

Yeah, they'll sign up for treasure but leave with the girl
Yeah, they'll sign up for treasure but leave with the girl
Yeah, they'll sign up for treasure but leave with the girl

And the mountain that drew us together is lit
By the lightning that crackles and rivals the wind
Where the only expression of love is through tears
And the highest creation on earth is a bird

The most powerful symbol achieved, let it burn
The most powerful symbol achieved, let it burn
